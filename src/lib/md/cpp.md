# C++ Programming Language

## Introduction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was designed to provide a higher level of abstraction and support for object-oriented programming.

## History
C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs. Stroustrup wanted to add features to the C language that would make it more suitable for large-scale software development. He introduced the concept of classes, which allowed for the implementation of object-oriented programming principles.

## Features
C++ combines the low-level capabilities of C with high-level abstractions, making it a powerful and versatile language. Some of its key features include:
- Object-oriented programming support
- Strong type checking
- Template metaprogramming
- Exception handling
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Operator overloading
- Multiple inheritance

## Code Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
