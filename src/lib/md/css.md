# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Introduction
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It provides a way to control the appearance of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.

## History
CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994, while he was working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). It was developed as a solution to the limitations of HTML in terms of styling and layout. The first CSS specification, CSS1, was released in 1996, followed by CSS2 in 1998 and CSS3 in 1999. Since then, CSS has undergone several updates and enhancements, with CSS3 being the latest major version.

## How CSS Works
CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements. It uses selectors to target specific elements and declarations to define the styles to be applied. Selectors can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, and more. Declarations consist of a property and a value, specifying how the selected elements should be styled.

## CSS Syntax

```css
/* Selects all paragraphs and sets the font color to red */
p {
    color: red;
}

/* Selects all headings with class "title" and sets the font size to 24px */
h1.title {
    font-size: 24px;
}

/* Selects all elements with the class "button" and sets the background color to blue */
.button {
    background-color: blue;
}
```
