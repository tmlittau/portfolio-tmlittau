# SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data.

## History of SQL

SQL was first developed in the early 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM. It was initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and was designed to manipulate and retrieve data from IBM's System R database management system.

In the late 1970s, the name was changed to SQL to avoid trademark conflicts. SQL gained popularity and became an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard in 1986. Since then, it has been widely adopted by database vendors and is now the de facto standard for relational databases.

## Key Features of SQL

SQL offers several key features that make it a powerful language for working with databases:

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL statements in SQL are used to define and manage the structure of databases. These statements allow users to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.

### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML statements in SQL are used to manipulate data within the database. Users can insert, update, and delete records in tables using DML statements.

### 3. Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL statements in SQL are used to retrieve data from the database. The SELECT statement is the most commonly used DQL statement, allowing users to query and retrieve specific data based on specified criteria.

### 4. Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL statements in SQL are used to control access to the database. These statements allow users to grant or revoke permissions on database objects, ensuring data security and integrity.

## Conclusion

SQL has revolutionized the way we interact with databases, providing a powerful and standardized language for managing and manipulating data. Its rich set of features and wide adoption make it an essential skill for anyone working with relational databases.
