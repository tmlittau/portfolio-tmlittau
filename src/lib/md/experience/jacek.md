# Project at the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Uppsala University

## Introduction

During my Master's studies at Uppsala University, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project at the Institute of Nuclear Physics. The goal of this project was to develop and implement a machine learning algorithm for discrimination of signal and background data obtained at the BESIII spectrometer in China. In this project, I focused on utilizing a Bayesian Neural Network due to its unique properties.

## Methodology

To achieve the project's objectives, I followed a systematic approach. First, I conducted a comprehensive literature review to gain a deep understanding of the BESIII spectrometer and the challenges associated with signal-background discrimination. This allowed me to identify the most suitable machine learning technique for the task.

Based on my research, I chose to implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) due to its ability to handle uncertainty and provide probabilistic predictions. The BNN was trained using a labeled dataset consisting of both signal and background data. I utilized advanced techniques such as dropout regularization and variational inference to improve the model's performance and robustness.

## Results and Impact

The implementation of the Bayesian Neural Network yielded promising results. The model achieved a high accuracy in discriminating signal from background data, surpassing the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms. The probabilistic nature of the BNN also allowed for uncertainty estimation, providing valuable insights into the reliability of the predictions.

The successful development and implementation of this machine learning algorithm have significant implications for the field of nuclear physics. It enhances our ability to analyze experimental data obtained from the BESIII spectrometer, leading to a better understanding of fundamental particles and their interactions.

## Conclusion

Working on this project at the Institute of Nuclear Physics was a rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of machine learning techniques to a real-world problem in the field of nuclear physics. The project's success highlights the potential of Bayesian Neural Networks in improving signal-background discrimination and advancing scientific research.
