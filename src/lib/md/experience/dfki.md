# Internship at DFKI RIC

## Introduction

During my internship at the DFKI RIC in Bremen, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project involving surface detection in autonomous vehicles. This project aimed to utilize Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and a TurtleBot to collect training data on different surfaces and train a set of models for surface prediction.

## Project Description

The main goal of the project was to develop a proof of concept study on surface detection. The study involved collecting training data using IMU sensors while the TurtleBot was moving on various surfaces. This data was then used to train a set of LSTM models, which are a type of recurrent neural network.

## Methodology

To achieve the project goals, the following steps were followed:

1. Data Collection: The TurtleBot was equipped with IMU sensors to collect data while traversing different surfaces. The data included various parameters such as acceleration, orientation, and velocity.

2. Model Training: The collected data was used to train a set of LSTM models. These models were trained to predict the surface the vehicle was currently moving on based on the IMU data.

3. Model Evaluation: The trained models were evaluated by comparing their predictions with the actual surface data. The model that provided the closest match to the real surface was considered the most accurate.

## Results and Conclusion

Through this project, we successfully developed a proof of concept study on surface detection in autonomous vehicles. The trained LSTM models showed promising results in predicting the surface based on IMU data. This project opens up possibilities for further research and development in the field of autonomous vehicle navigation.

## Conclusion

My internship at DFKI RIC provided me with valuable hands-on experience in working on a real-world project in the field of autonomous vehicles. I gained insights into data collection, model training, and evaluation techniques. This experience has further fueled my passion for machine learning and its applications in the automotive industry.
