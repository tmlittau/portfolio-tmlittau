# C Programming Language

C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a high-level language known for its efficiency, portability, and low-level programming capabilities.

## Domains of Usage

C has influenced many other programming languages and is widely used in various domains, including:
- System programming
- Embedded systems
- Application development

## Origins and Standards

C was initially created to develop the Unix operating system, which played a significant role in its popularity. Over the years, C has evolved and standardized through various versions, with the most widely used being the ANSI C standard (C89/C90) and the ISO C standard (C99/C11).

## Features and Capabilities

C provides a rich set of features, including:
- Low-level memory manipulation
- Structured programming constructs
- A large standard library

It allows direct access to memory addresses, making it suitable for system-level programming. C also supports procedural programming paradigms, making it easy to organize code into reusable functions.

## Relevance and Popularity

Despite being a relatively old language, C remains relevant and widely used today. Its simplicity, efficiency, and close-to-the-hardware nature make it a popular choice for developing performance-critical applications and operating systems.

## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
