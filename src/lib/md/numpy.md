# NumPy

## Introduction
NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

## History
NumPy was first created by Travis Olliphant in 2005 as an open-source project. It was initially inspired by the desire to have a more efficient way to perform numerical computations in Python. NumPy was designed to overcome the limitations of the built-in Python data structures and provide a high-performance alternative for numerical operations.

## Features
- Multi-dimensional array objects: NumPy provides a powerful `ndarray` object that allows efficient storage and manipulation of large arrays.
- Mathematical functions: NumPy includes a comprehensive collection of mathematical functions, such as trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and linear algebra operations.
- Broadcasting: NumPy supports broadcasting, which allows operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes.
- Integration with other libraries: NumPy seamlessly integrates with other popular Python libraries, such as SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, making it a fundamental building block for scientific computing.
