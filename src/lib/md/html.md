# HTML: Hypertext Markup Language

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and applications. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, defining the elements and their relationships.

## History of HTML

HTML was first introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a means to share scientific information among researchers. The initial version, HTML 1.0, was a simple language with limited capabilities. Over the years, HTML has evolved through various versions, each introducing new features and improvements.

### HTML 2.0

HTML 2.0, released in 1995, introduced several new elements and attributes, including tables, image maps, and form elements. This version laid the foundation for more complex web page layouts and interactivity.

### HTML 3.2

HTML 3.2, released in 1997, brought significant enhancements to the language. It introduced support for frames, which allowed multiple web pages to be displayed within a single browser window. Additionally, new form elements and multimedia capabilities were introduced.

### HTML 4.01

HTML 4.01, released in 1999, further expanded the capabilities of HTML. It introduced support for cascading style sheets (CSS), which enabled developers to separate the presentation of a webpage from its structure. This version also introduced scripting support through JavaScript.

### HTML5

HTML5, the latest major version of HTML, was released in 2014. It introduced a wide range of new features and improvements, including semantic elements, multimedia support, canvas for drawing graphics, and enhanced form controls. HTML5 also introduced the concept of web APIs, allowing web applications to access device-specific features.

## Conclusion

HTML has come a long way since its inception, evolving into a powerful and versatile language for creating web pages and applications. Its continuous development and adoption of new standards have played a crucial role in shaping the modern web.
