To finish a course in Computer Graphics I had to show a PBR textured object. In order to do that I built a model viewer in C++ using OpenGL to show different attributes of the model such as diffuse, metalness, specular and ambient occlusion texture. 
# University Project in Computer Graphics

## Introduction
For my Master's degree at Uppsala University, I completed a university project in the field of Computer Graphics. The project focused on developing a model viewer using C++ and OpenGL.

## Objective
The main objective of the project was to showcase my understanding of Computer Graphics concepts and techniques, specifically in the area of physically-based rendering (PBR). 

## Implementation
I implemented a model viewer application that allowed users to load and interact with 3D models. The application utilized OpenGL for rendering and supported various PBR attributes such as diffuse, metalness, specular, and ambient occlusion textures.

## Features
The model viewer application included the following features:
- Loading and rendering of 3D models
- Real-time manipulation of camera position and orientation
- Support for different PBR attributes for realistic rendering
- Interactive controls for adjusting material properties

## Conclusion
Through this university project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in implementing Computer Graphics concepts and techniques. The model viewer application served as a practical demonstration of my knowledge and skills in the field of Computer Graphics.
