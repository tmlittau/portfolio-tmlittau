# Image Labelling Tool for Neuropathological Image Analysis

## Introduction

The Image Labelling Tool is a software application developed for the Institute of Neuropathology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). Its primary purpose is to assist in the analysis of brain tissue images from Alzheimer's patients.

## Features

### Protein Deposit Labelling

One of the key features of the tool is the ability to label protein deposits in brain tissue images. This allows researchers to identify and categorize different types of protein deposits, which is crucial for understanding the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

### Region of Interest (ROI) Drawing

The tool also provides functionality to draw polygonal Regions of Interest (ROI) on the images. These ROIs can be used to quantify the spatial frequency of the different protein deposits, providing valuable insights into their distribution patterns.

## Benefits

### Standardized Analysis

The tool promotes standardized analysis by providing consistent labelling and ROI drawing methods. This ensures that different researchers working on the same dataset can achieve comparable results, enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of the analysis.

### Data Labelling

The main purpose of this tool was to provide a way to quickly label image data in order to feed supervised learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Conclusion

The Image Labelling Tool developed for the Institute of Neuropathology at the UKE is a powerful software application that streamlines the analysis of brain tissue images in Alzheimer's research. Its features and benefits contribute to more efficient and standardized analysis, ultimately advancing the ability to integrate machine learning algorithms into the image analysis.
