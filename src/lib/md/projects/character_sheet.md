# Character Sheet Web Application

## Overview
The Character Sheet Web Application is a project built using Svelte and Django. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing character sheets for tabletop role-playing games in the Wizarding World. The application allows users to create, edit, and delete character sheets, as well as track various attributes and abilities of their characters.

## Features
- User Authentication: The application includes a user authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and securely log in.
- Character Creation: Users can create new character sheets by providing basic information such as name, race, class, and background.
- Attribute Tracking: The application provides a user-friendly interface for tracking various attributes of characters, such as strength, dexterity, intelligence, and more.
- Ability Management: Users can add, edit, and remove abilities for their characters, allowing them to keep track of special skills, spells, or other unique abilities.
- Character Sheet Templates: The application includes a pre-defined character sheet template for a tabletop role-playing game in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
- Responsive Design: The web application is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used
- Svelte: The front-end of the application is built using the Svelte framework, which provides a reactive and efficient way to build user interfaces.
- Django: The back-end of the application is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- SQLite: The application uses SQLite as the database management system to store and retrieve character sheet data. This decision was made due to its light weight and portability.
