# Angular Web Framework

## Introduction
Angular is a popular web framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used for building dynamic and scalable web applications. In this guide, we will explore the key features and concepts of Angular.

## History
Angular was first released by Google in 2010 as AngularJS. It quickly gained popularity among developers due to its powerful features and ease of use. However, as web development evolved, AngularJS faced some limitations, leading to the development of Angular.

In 2016, Google released Angular 2, a complete rewrite of AngularJS. Angular 2 introduced a component-based architecture and improved performance. Since then, Angular has continued to evolve with regular updates and releases.

## Key Features
- TypeScript: Angular is built using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript provides better tooling, type checking, and code organization.
- Component-based architecture: Angular follows a component-based architecture, where the application is divided into reusable and independent components.
- Dependency Injection: Angular provides a powerful dependency injection system, making it easier to manage dependencies and write testable code.
- Reactive programming: Angular leverages reactive programming with RxJS to handle asynchronous operations and manage data streams.
- Angular CLI: Angular CLI is a command-line interface that provides a set of tools for creating, building, and testing Angular applications.

## Conclusion
Angular is a mature and powerful web framework that offers a wide range of features and tools for building modern web applications. Its component-based architecture, dependency injection, and reactive programming capabilities make it a popular choice among developers. With regular updates and a strong community support, Angular continues to evolve and stay relevant in the ever-changing web development landscape.
